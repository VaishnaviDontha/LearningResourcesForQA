### Test Cases
A bunch / A set of steps to verify whether the software is performing respective functions for a desired output. <br>

A Test case contains below following attributes to make it a accepted Test case. <br>

* Test Suite ID : ID of the Test Suite. <br>
* Test Case ID : ID of the Test Case.<br>
* Summary of Test Case : Overview of the Test Case.<br>
* Requirements : Setups or plugins required to run a testt case.<br>
* Test Procedure : Step by Step guide of a use case.<br>
* Prerequisities : Prior requirements neede to execute a Test.<br>
* Test Data : Inputs to the Software<br>
* Result Expected : Expected behaviour from the software.<br>
* Actual Result : Actual result or the output from the software when tested with the data given. <br>
* Status : Test Status i.e., Pass/Fail/Bug.<br>
* Creation Date : Creation date of the Test Case.<br>
* Executed By : Name of the person by whom the test has been performed.<br>
* Environment : This includes type of Platform, Operating System through which the tests have been performed.<br> 

If a good test case is not written or developed the actual performance of the software is under estimated. So, it is important to have a proper set of test cases created. With these, positive and negative test scenarios should also be included which will reduce the risk of errors in the software. 


### Good Practices for writing Test Case : 
* They must be simple and transparent - Easy understandable.
* Clear and Simple.
* Must be easy understandable to the end user.
* Repetition of the test cases must be avoided.
* Every Test case should hold a unique ID, so that any user can be easily referred to it.
* Should ensure 100% coverage of the functionalities are covered.
* Peer Review must be taken.
