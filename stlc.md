* Requirement Analysis 
    1. This is the First step involved in STLC. Here, the Testing team understands and analyzes the buisness requirements.
    2. Team may interact with various stake holders to identify the testable requirements in detail.
    3. These requirements can be of Functional and Non-Functional.
    4. Also, gathers the teating priorities.
    
* Test Planning 
    1. At this stage, the Teat Manager makes a plan determining the cost and effort for the product.
    2. Preparation of test plan/type of testing to be done are made here.
    3. Also, includes roles and responsibilities.
  This stage is also refered as Test Strategy.

* Test case development phase
    1. At this phase, the team involves in the creation of test cases along with the test data.
    2. Team also starts with the development process of the test cases for the individual units and are peer reviewed or by the QA lead.

* Test Enviroment Setup 
    1. This part plays a major role of the STLC as setting up the test enviroment is the major part.
    2. Team will get a exposure to understand the enviroment to prepare respective hardware and software.
    3. Also, this can help to perform a Smoke test once the setup is ready.

* Test Execution Phase
    1. In this phase, the testing of the software is done based on the test cases and the test data captured at the early stages.
    2. It consisits of test script execution, script maintainance and reporting of bugs.
    3. If a Bug is reported it is reverted back to the DEV team and the re-testing will be done with the respective test data/scripts captured.

* Test Cycle Closure
    1. This is the final phase of the STLC which involves Test Coverage, Cost, Time, etc.
    2. Team prepares a Test Closure report(A Report which describes the testing actives performed by QA)
